34571541,Rossmann-toolbox: a deep learning-based protocol for the prediction and design of cofactor specificity in Rossmann fold proteins.,"The Rossmann fold enzymes are involved in essential biochemical pathways such as nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Their functioning relies on interaction with cofactors, small nucleoside-based compounds specifically recognized by a conserved βαβ motif shared by all Rossmann fold proteins. While Rossmann methyltransferases recognize only a single cofactor type, the S-adenosylmethionine, the oxidoreductases, depending on the family, bind nicotinamide (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) or flavin-based (flavin adenine dinucleotide) cofactors. In this study, we showed that despite its short length, the βαβ motif unambiguously defines the specificity towards the cofactor. Following this observation, we trained two complementary deep learning models for the prediction of the cofactor specificity based on the sequence and structural features of the βαβ motif. A benchmark on two independent test sets, one containing βαβ motifs bearing no resemblance to those of the training set, and the other comprising 38 experimentally confirmed cases of rational design of the cofactor specificity, revealed the nearly perfect performance of the two methods. The Rossmann-toolbox protocols can be accessed via the webserver at https://lbs.cent.uw.edu.pl/rossmann-toolbox and are available as a Python package at https://github.com/labstructbioinf/rossmann-toolbox.",2021-09-28,10.1093/bib/bbab371,"[{'lastname': 'Kamiński', 'firstname': 'Kamil', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Structural Bioinformatics, Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Ludwiczak', 'firstname': 'Jan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Structural Bioinformatics, Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.\nLaboratory of Bioinformatics, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Pasteura 3, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Jasiński', 'firstname': 'Maciej', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Structural Bioinformatics, Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Bukala', 'firstname': 'Adriana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Structural Bioinformatics, Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Madaj', 'firstname': 'Rafal', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, Sienkiewicza 112, 90-363, Lodz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Szczepaniak', 'firstname': 'Krzysztof', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Structural Bioinformatics, Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Dunin-Horkawicz', 'firstname': 'Stanisław', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Structural Bioinformatics, Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.'}]"
34571538,A comprehensive review of online resources for microRNA-diseases associations: the state of the art.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as small 19- to 24-nucleotide noncoding RNAs regulate several mRNA targets and signaling pathways. Therefore, miRNAs are considered key regulators in cellular pathways as well as various pathologies. There is substantial interest in the relationship between disease and miRNAs, which made that one of the important research topics. Interestingly, miRNAs emerged as an attractive approach for clinical application, not only as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis or in the prediction of therapy response but also as therapeutic tools. For these purposes, the identification of crucial miRNAs in disease is very important. Databases provided valuable experimental and computational miRNAs-disease information in an accessible and comprehensive manner, such as miRNA target genes, miRNA related in signaling pathways and miRNA involvement in various diseases. In this review, we summarized miRNAs-disease databases in two main categories based on the general or specific diseases. In these databases, researchers could search diseases to identify critical miRNAs and developed that for clinical applications. In another way, by searching particular miRNAs, they could recognize in which disease these miRNAs would be dysregulated. Despite the significant development that has been done in these databases, there are still some limitations, such as not being updated and not providing uniform and detailed information that should be resolved in future databases. This survey can be helpful as a comprehensive reference for choosing a suitable database by researchers and as a guideline for comparing the features and limitations of the database by developer or designer. Short abstract We summarized miRNAs-disease databases that researchers could search disease to identify critical miRNAs and developed that for clinical applications. This survey can help choose a suitable database for researchers.",2021-09-28,10.1093/bib/bbab381,"[{'lastname': 'Mahjoubin-Tehran', 'firstname': 'Maryam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Bioinformatics Research Group, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran and Department of Medical Biotechnology and Nanotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Rezaei', 'firstname': 'Samaneh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Bioinformatics Research Group, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran and Department of Medical Biotechnology and Nanotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Jalili', 'firstname': 'Amin', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Bioinformatics Research Group, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran and Department of Medical Biotechnology and Nanotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Sahebkar', 'firstname': 'Amirhossein', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Bioinformatics Research Group, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran and Department of Medical Biotechnology and Nanotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Aghaee-Bakhtiari', 'firstname': 'Seyed Hamid', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': None}]"
34571534,Representation of molecules for drug response prediction.,"The rapid development of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in the recent decade has spurred an outburst of their applications in many research fields. In the chemistry domain, machine learning has been widely used to aid in drug screening, drug toxicity prediction, quantitative structure-activity relationship prediction, anti-cancer synergy score prediction, etc. This review is dedicated to the application of machine learning in drug response prediction. Specifically, we focus on molecular representations, which is a crucial element to the success of drug response prediction and other chemistry-related prediction tasks.

34571364,Dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis in human lung cancer tissue and tumour-associated macrophages.,"Based on reports on elevated cholesterol levels in cancer cells, strategies to lower cholesterol synthesis have been suggested as an antitumour strategy. However, cholesterol depletion has also been shown to induce tumour-promoting actions in tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs).
We performed lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses of human lung cancer material. To assess whether the TAM phenotype is shaped by secreted factors produced by tumour cells, primary human monocyte-derived macrophages were polarized towards a TAM-like phenotype using tumour cell-conditioned medium.
Lipidomic analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (n=29) and adjacent non-tumour tissues (n=22) revealed a significant accumulation of free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters within the tumour tissue. In contrast, cholesterol levels were reduced in TAMs isolated from lung adenocarcinoma tissues when compared with alveolar macrophages (AMs) obtained from adjacent non-tumour tissues. Bulk-RNA-Seq revealed that genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism were downregulated in TAMs, while cholesterol efflux transporters were upregulated. In vitro polarized TAM-like macrophages showed an attenuated lipogenic gene expression signature and exhibited lower cholesterol levels compared with non-polarized macrophages. A genome-wide comparison by bulk RNA-Seq confirmed a high similarity of ex vivo TAMs and in vitro TAM-like macrophages. Modulation of intracellular cholesterol levels by either starving, cholesterol depletion, or efflux transporter inhibition indicated that cholesterol distinctly shapes macrophage gene expression.
Our data show an opposite dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis in tumour tissue vs. TAMs. Polarization of in vitro differentiated macrophages by tumour cell-conditioned medium recapitulates key features of ex vivo TAMs.",2021-09-28,10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103578,"[{'lastname': 'Hoppstädter', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Biology, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Dembek', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Biology, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Höring', 'firstname': 'Marcus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schymik', 'firstname': 'Hanna S', 'initials': 'HS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Biology, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Dahlem', 'firstname': 'Charlotte', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Biology, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Sultan', 'firstname': 'Afnan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Center for Bioinformatics, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wirth', 'firstname': 'Natalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Center for Bioinformatics, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Fityan', 'firstname': 'Salma', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Biology, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Diesel', 'firstname': 'Britta', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Biology, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gasparoni', 'firstname': 'Gilles', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Genetics/Epigenetics, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Walter', 'firstname': 'Jörn', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Genetics/Epigenetics, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Helms', 'firstname': 'Volkhard', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Center for Bioinformatics, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Huwer', 'firstname': 'Hanno', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Völklingen Heart Center, Völklingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Simon', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Cell Biology and Microbiology, University of Wuppertal, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Wuppertal, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Liebisch', 'firstname': 'Gerhard', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schulz', 'firstname': 'Marcel H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Cardiovascular Regeneration, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kiemer', 'firstname': 'Alexandra K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Biology, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.

34571355,Clinicopathological and prognostic value of STAT3/p-STAT3 in cervical cancer: A meta and bioinformatics analysis.,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) is an important member of the STAT family. Studies have found that it can participate in cell signal transduction and transcriptional activation. STAT3 plays an important role in tumor angiogenesis, immunity and tumor invasion and metastasis. Previous studies have found that STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3(p-STAT3) are abnormally expressed in cervical cancer. In the research, we systematically analyzed the expression of STAT3 and phospho-STAT3(p-STAT3) in cervical cancer tissues and their correlation with clinicopathological features in patients with cervical cancer. We searched literature using PubMed, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI) on 10th Dec, 2020. Our results showed that the expression of STAT3 and p-STAT3 in cervical cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in normal tissues and cervical intraepithelial lesions, and the expression of STAT3 in cervical intraepithelial lesions was higher than that in normal cervical tissues (P < 0.05). The expression of STAT3 in cervical squamous cell carcinoma tissue was higher than that in adenocarcinoma tissue(p < 0.05). A positive association was found STAT3 expression and Lymph node metastasis, Infiltrating depth and TNM staging of cervical cancer patients(p < 0.05). p-STAT3 expression was also associated with Dedifferentiation, Lymph node metastasis and Depth of invasion(p < 0.05). According to oncomine database, STAT3 mRNA and DNA expression were obviously higher in cervical cancer tissue than cervix uteri tissue(p < 0.05). According to kmplotter, GEPIA and UALCAN databases, the expression of STAT3 in cervical cancer tissues is higher than that in normal tissues(p < 0.05), but it has no significant correlation with the prognosis of patients(p > 0.05). The high expression of STAT3 and p-STAT3 might be a potential marker for tumor occurrence and metastasis in cervical cancer patients.",2021-09-28,10.1016/j.prp.2021.153624,"[{'lastname': 'Shi', 'firstname': 'Shuai', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pathology, Cangzhou People's Hospital, Cangzhou 061000, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Ma', 'firstname': 'Hong-Yan', 'initials': 'HY', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pathology, Cangzhou People's Hospital, Cangzhou 061000, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Zhi-Gang', 'initials': 'ZG', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pathology, Cangzhou People's Hospital, Cangzhou 061000, China.

34571259,Mouse Single Islet β Cell Transcriptomic Reveals Sexually Dimorphic Transcriptome and Type 2 Diabetes Genes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D), characterized by the malfunction of pancreatic β cells, is affected by multiple factors, including sex differences. However, the mechanisms of sex differences in T2D susceptibility and pathogenesis remain unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we show sexually dimorphic transcriptomes exist in mouse β cells. Using a high-fat diet induced T2D mouse model, our work reveals the existence of sex-dependent T2D altered genes, suggesting sex-based differences in the pathological mechanisms of T2D. Our results, including sex-matched and sex-mismatched islet transplantation experiments in mice, suggest sex should be considered when treating T2D. As compared to sex-matched transplants, sex-mismatched transplants showed downregulation of genes involved in the longevity regulating pathway of β cells and led to impaired glucose tolerance in diabetic mice. Taken together, our findings further implicate sexual dimorphism in T2D pathogenicity and provides novel insights towards the development of precision medicine in T2D.",2021-09-28,10.1016/j.gpb.2021.07.004,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Gang', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Translational Medical Center for Stem Cell Therapy and Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Frontier Science Center for Stem Cell Research, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China; Tsingtao Advanced Research Institute, Tongji University, Qingdao 266073, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yana', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'CAS Key Laboratory of Computational Biology, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Tengjiao', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Translational Medical Center for Stem Cell Therapy and Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Frontier Science Center for Stem Cell Research, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Mushan', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, State College 16802, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Sheng', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Translational Medical Center for Stem Cell Therapy and Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Frontier Science Center for Stem Cell Research, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China; Tsingtao Advanced Research Institute, Tongji University, Qingdao 266073, China.'}, {'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Qing', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Translational Medical Center for Stem Cell Therapy and Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Frontier Science Center for Stem Cell Research, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China; Tsingtao Advanced Research Institute, Tongji University, Qingdao 266073, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Shuxin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Translational Medical Center for Stem Cell Therapy and Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Frontier Science Center for Stem Cell Research, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China; Tsingtao Advanced Research Institute, Tongji University, Qingdao 266073, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Minglu', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Translational Medical Center for Stem Cell Therapy and Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Frontier Science Center for Stem Cell Research, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China; Tsingtao Advanced Research Institute, Tongji University, Qingdao 266073, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xiao', 'firstname': 'Tinghui', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Translational Medical Center for Stem Cell Therapy and Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Frontier Science Center for Stem Cell Research, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China; Tsingtao Advanced Research Institute, Tongji University, Qingdao 266073, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shao', 'firstname': 'Zhen', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'CAS Key Laboratory of Computational Biology, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.

34571128,Chronic in vitro fermentation and in vivo metabolism: Extracellular polysaccharides from Sporidiobolus pararoseus regulate the intestinal microbiome of humans and mice.,"The fungus Sporidiobolus pararoseus not only produces carotenoids, but also produces bioactive extracellular polysaccharides (SPP). However, the relationship between SPP and the metabolism of gut microbiome is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of SPP regulating intestinal health in vivo and in vitro. Results showed that SPP are nondigestible polysaccharides after the digestion with simulated stomach and small intestinal juice in vitro. After SPP was cultured in an in vitro intestinal simulation system for seven days, the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) increased; the microbial diversity changed; the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus increased; and that of Escherichia Shigella and Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 decreased. In addition, metabolism of SPP by the mice colonic microbiome showed SPP decreased the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota, while the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobiota, Desulfobacterota, and Actinobacteriota increased. Finally, predicted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolism results also showed that SPP can enhance the metabolism of cofactors, vitamins, amino acids, starch, and sucrose. In conclusion, SPP can multiply the intestinal beneficial bacteria of humans and mice, promote the production of SCFAs and metabolism of amino acids, and promote intestinal health.",2021-09-28,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.09.127,"[{'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Bin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'The Key Laboratory of Industrial Biotechnology, Ministry of Education, School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Chang', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, School of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China; International Joint Laboratory on Food Safety, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Wenhao', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, School of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China; International Joint Laboratory on Food Safety, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Hongkang', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, School of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China; International Joint Laboratory on Food Safety, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Hui', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'China Certification & Inspection Group Shanghai Co., Ltd, Shanghai 200120, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Qian', 'firstname': 'He', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, School of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China; International Joint Laboratory on Food Safety, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Weiguo', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'The Key Laboratory of Industrial Biotechnology, Ministry of Education, School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China.
